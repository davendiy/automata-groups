# automata-groups
Small Python framework for working with Automaton Groups and visualization of some
their properties.

It is a part of my bachelor thesis, the full text of
which can be found [here](./latex/bachelor_work/Bachelor.pdf).

[Demo](./demo) (it will be extended soon).


Have no idea why it doesn't work from makefile or venv, so one should install it manually. 

Installation: 
```
pip install Cython 
pip install .
make clean 
```
